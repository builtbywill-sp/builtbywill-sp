# 🧠 workflow__BuiltByWill

I don’t just write code — I architect my environment, secure my system, and deploy like it matters.

This is the full blueprint of how I build:
- My OS and encryption setup
- My coding rituals and Git philosophy
- My AI command stack
- My security lockdown protocols

It’s not just workflow — it’s a *protocol stack* for creative autonomy.
