# ðŸ§  Scripts â€“ Workflow Engine

This folder contains the backend logic for CLI automation.  
All commands here are executed by higher-level launchers like `spawn.sh` or `ui__console.sh`.

Every script is standalone and chainable.

## Highlights

- **Modular Design:** Files can be sourced or run directly
- **Built for Speed:** Git init, VS Code launch, and tagging in seconds
- **Secure by Default:** Nothing leaves local unless you push

> Scripts are battle-tested and evolve alongside the method. No bloat. Just execution.
