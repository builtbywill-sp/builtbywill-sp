# ⚙️ CLI Automations – BuiltByWill

This folder contains shell scripts and command tools used to automate front-end project workflows.  
Each script is modular, extensible, and designed to be run from the terminal with a single line.

## Contents

- `spawn.sh` — Instantly generates a licensed, git-initialized, VS Code–ready repo
- `setup__License--Templates.sh` — Creates base license folders with boilerplate files
- `inject__BW-Hash.sh` — Adds authorship signals via `.bw_hash` and invisible markers
- `devconsole.sh` — Parses natural-language commands like “create mit repo called x”
- `ui__console.sh` — (Coming soon) Interactive terminal UI for automation access

> 🔒 All files are local-first, offline-capable, and part of the Red Collar method stack.
