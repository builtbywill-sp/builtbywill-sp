## 🧠 BuiltByWill — Frontend Flow. Terminal Logic.

I build lightning-fast frontends and handcrafted logic systems.  
Not just websites — full-stack experiences with discipline and autonomy.

### 💻 System Projects (Low-Level Logic)

> Frontend is the interface. Logic is the soul.

- **coldmetal.c** — Pure C-based transformer REPL with memory recall and semantic logic. Built with no Python, no torch, and zero dependencies.  
> ⚠️ Not frontend, but I believe UI devs should master the stack beneath the screen.

---

### 🧠 Philosophy

- Don’t wait to be told what to build
- Systems > Sites
- Autonomy > Buzzwords
- Feedback > Flattery
