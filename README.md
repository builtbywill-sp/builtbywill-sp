# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm William â€” aka @builtbywill

I build tools, not just templates.  
I don't chase perfection â€” I ship and I sharpen.

---

## ğŸ”§ Current Grind
- Building [Frontend Gauntlet](https://github.com/builtbywilldev/frontend__Gauntlet) â€“ a challenge log, not a portfolio
- Deploying real-world UI projects
- Experimenting with AI systems and full autonomy

---

## ğŸ§  About Me
- I break problems down until they get scared
- I train like Iâ€™m already on the team
- I believe reps > resumes
