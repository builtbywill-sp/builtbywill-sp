## 🎨 BuiltByWill — Frontend Flow Meets Terminal Precision

I build fast, responsive frontends with handcrafted logic under the hood.  
Not just websites — full-stack experiences. Logged, styled, and deployed with discipline.

---

### 🚧 Currently Building

• `Violet-Collar` → OS-style UI built in React with terminal-inspired styling  
• `Frontend_Gauntlet` → challenge-driven UI reps & showcase playground  


---

### 📅 Roadmap

• 🟢 Push daily commits with real work  
• 🟣 Finish front-end bootcamp, ship 3 live apps  
• 🔵 Launch Morpheus MVP with offline CLI AI  
• 🟡 Sell RepoForge v2 for $1 and track usage *(coming soon)*  

---

### 👨‍🎨 About Me

• I train like I'm already hired  
• I write clean, class-based CSS (BEM is life)  
• I believe design is a function, not decoration  

---

### 💻 Frontend Stack

• HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6+)  
• React / Git / GitHub / CLI tooling  
• Terminal workflows + component-first thinking  
• BEM, Flexbox, Grid, transitions, accessibility

---

### 🛠 Featured Tools

• **Violet Collar** — secure React UI built like a desktop shell *(UI-first, responsive, dark-mode-ready)*  
• **RepoForge** — 1-click repo generator with LICENSE, README, git, and branding  
• **Morpheus** — offline AI engine with memory, command chaining, and local ops
