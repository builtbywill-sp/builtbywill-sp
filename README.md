## ⚙️ BuiltByWill — Frontend Precision Meets Terminal Flow

I build lightning-fast frontends and handcrafted systems under the hood.  
Not just websites — full-stack experiences, styled with discipline and engineered for autonomy.

### 👨‍💻 About Me

- I train like I'm already hired  
- I write clean, semantic CSS — BEM is life  
- I believe design is function, not decoration  
- I build systems, not just sites

---

### 🧰 Frontend Tech Stack

- **Languages**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, CLI tooling, Git  
- **Styling**: BEM, Flexbox, Grid, Transitions, A11y  
- **Workflow**: Terminal-first, component-driven

### 🧠 Side Projects

> Pure logic. No frameworks. Just brainpower.

- **coldmetal.c** — Offline transformer REPL in C (no Python, no torch). Built for zero-dependency AI inference.
⚠️ Not frontend — but I believe frontend devs should be fearless with logic.
