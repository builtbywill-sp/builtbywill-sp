# 📜 Development Phases — BuiltByWill Protocol

This is how I build — with structure, intent, and tactical evolution.  
Each project moves through named phases, with clear objectives and documented progress.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> I don’t “work on features.”  
> I run operations. I ship phases.

Each phase is a checkpoint. A system milestone.  
Progress isn’t accidental — it’s operational.

## 📦 Example Phase Structure

**Phase 1 – Boot Sequence:**  
Initial folder structure, repo creation, and README setup

**Phase 2 – UI Shell:**  
Basic HTML/CSS structure with BEM logic and responsive layout

**Phase 3 – Core Logic:**  
JavaScript or React base implementation, handling real user input

**Phase 4 – AI Layer (if applicable):**  
GPT integration, memory loop, autonomous triggers

**Phase 5 – Deployment:**  
GitHub push, public demo link, backups, license

Each one ships in stages.  
Each one logs real ops.

## 🧭 Why It Matters

This system keeps me accountable, focused, and scalable.  
Even when solo — I build like a team.
